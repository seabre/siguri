#Siguri

A very example of an emergency "button" that changes the whole webpage to a completely different one. Also, if the special keypress is not pressed, then the page will continue to display the completely different page.

To disable the "new" page, wait 5 seconds, then press 7.

Tested with Firefox and Chrome. Does not appear to work with Firefox yet.
